Make: Using pre defined Environments
====================================

Objectives
-----------
The function define in this module is the easiest and most convenient ways to create a valid
:class:`grid2op.Environment.Environment`.

To get started with such an environment, you can simply do:

.. code-block:: python

    import grid2op
    env = grid2op.make("rte_case14_realistic")


You can consult the different notebooks in the `getting_stared` directory of this package for more information on
how to use it.

Created Environment should behave exactly like a gym environment. If you notice any unwanted behavior, please address
an issue in the official grid2op repository: `Grid2Op <https://github.com/rte-france/Grid2Op>`_

The environment created with this method should be fully compatible with the gym framework: if you are developing
a new algorithm of "Reinforcement Learning" and you used the openai gym framework to do so, you can port your code
in a few minutes (basically this consists in adapting the input and output dimension of your BaseAgent) and make it work
with a Grid2Op environment. An example of such modifications is exposed in the getting_started/ notebooks.

Important notes
---------------
As of version 0.8.0 a ":func:`make`" has been updated in grid2op. This function, replace the current implementation of
renamed :func:`make_old`, merges the behaviour of "grid2op.download" script and "make_old" function.

It has the following behavior:

1) if you specify a full path to a local environment (containing the chronics and the default parameters),
   it will be used
2) if you specify the name of an environmnet that you have already downloaded, it will use this environment (NB
   currently no checks are implemented if the environment has been updated remotely, which can happen if
   we realize there were some issues with it.)
3) if you provided no arguments a default environment will be used: ``rte_case14_realistic`` 
4) if the flag `test` is set to ``False`` (default behaviour) and none of the above conditions are met, the
   :func:`make` will download the data of this environment locally the first time it is called. If you don't want
   to download anything then you can pass the flag ``test=True``
5) if ``test=True`` (NON default behaviour) nothing will be loaded, and the :func:`make` will attempt to use a
   pre defined environment provided with the python package. We want to emphasize that because the environments provided
   with this package contains only little data, they are not suitable for leaning a consistent agent / controler. That
   is why a warning is sent in this case. Also, keep in mind that if you don't pass ``test=True`` then you will not
   have the possibility to search for these environments provided in the package.
6) if no valid environment is found, :func:`make` throws a EnvError.

Cache manipulation
-------------------------------
Editing the file ``~/.grid2opconfig.json`` allows you to change the data cache location. Programatically, it can be
done with :func:`change_local_dir`.

Call :func:`get_current_local_dir` to get the local cache directory location.

You can list the environments in the local cache directory by calling :func:`list_available_local_env` and list all
available environments with :func:`list_available_remote_env`.
