class BaseObservation(GridObjects):
    """
    Basic class representing an observation.

    All observation must derive from this class and implement all its abstract methods.

        The current flow at the extremity end of each powerline (expressed in A).

    rho: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:float
        The capacity of each powerline. It is defined at the observed current flow divided by the thermal limit of each
        powerline (no unit)

    connectivity_matrix_: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:float
        The connectivityt matrix (if computed, or None) see definition of :func:`connectivity_matrix` for
        more information

    bus_connectivity_matrix_: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:float
        The `bus_connectivity_matrix_` matrix (if computed, or None) see definition of
          :func:`BaseObservation.bus_connectivity_matrix` for more information

    vectorized: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:float
        The vector representation of this BaseObservation (if computed, or None) see definition of
        :func:`to_vect` for more information.

    topo_vect:  :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:int
        For each object (load, generator, ends of a powerline) it gives on which bus this object is connected
        in its substation. See :func:`grid2op.Backend.Backend.get_topo_vect` for more information.

    line_status: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:bool
        Gives the status (connected / disconnected) for every powerline (``True`` at position `i` means the powerline
        `i` is connected)

    timestep_overflow: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:int
        Gives the number of time steps since a powerline is in overflow.

    time_before_cooldown_line:  :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:int
        For each powerline, it gives the number of time step the powerline is unavailable due to "cooldown"
        (see :attr:`grid2op.Parameters.Parameters.NB_TIMESTEP_LINE_STATUS_REMODIF` for more information). 0 means the
        an action will be able to act on this same powerline, a number > 0 (eg 1) means that an action at this time step
        cannot act on this powerline (in the example the agent have to wait 1 time step)

    time_before_cooldown_sub: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:int
        Same as :attr:`BaseObservation.time_before_cooldown_line` but for substations. For each substation, it gives the
        number of timesteps to wait before acting on this substation (see
        see :attr:`grid2op.Parameters.Parameters.NB_TIMESTEP_TOPOLOGY_REMODIF` for more information).

    time_next_maintenance: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:int
        For each powerline, it gives the time of the next planned maintenance. For example if there is:

            - `1` at position `i` it means that the powerline `i` will be disconnected for maintenance operation at
              the next time step.
            - `0` at position `i` means that powerline `i` is disconnected from the powergrid for maintenance operation
              at the current time step.
            - `-1` at position `i` means that powerline `i` will not be disconnected for maintenance reason for this
              episode.
            - `k` > 1 at position `i` it means that the powerline `i` will be disconnected for maintenance operation at
              in `k` time steps

    duration_next_maintenance: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:int
        For each powerline, it gives the number of time step that the maintenance will last (if any). This means that,
        if at position `i` of this vector:

            - there is a `0`: the powerline is not disconnected from the grid for maintenance
            - there is a `1`, `2`, ... the powerline will be disconnected for at least `1`, `2`, ... timestep (**NB**
              in all case, the powerline will stay disconnected until a :class:`grid2op.BaseAgent.BaseAgent` performs the
              proper :class:`grid2op.BaseAction.BaseAction` to reconnect it).

    target_dispatch: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:float
        For **each** generators, it gives the target redispatching, asked by the agent. This is the sum of all
        redispatching asked by the agent for during all the episode. It for each generator it is a number between:
        - pmax and pmax. Note that there is information about all generators there, even the one that are not
        dispatchable.

    actual_dispatch: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:float
        For **each** generators, it gives the redispatching currently implemented by the environment.
        Indeed, the environment tries to implement at best the :attr:`BaseObservation.target_dispatch`, but sometimes,
        due to physical limitation (pmin, pmax, ramp min and ramp max) it cannot. In this case, only the best possible
        redispatching is implemented at the current time step, and this is what this vector stores. Note that there is
        information about all generators there, even the one that are not
        dispatchable.

        Test the equality of two actions.

        2 actions are said to be identical if the have the same impact on the powergrid. This is unlrelated to their
        respective class. For example, if an BaseAction is of class :class:`BaseAction` and doesn't act on the _injection, it
        can be equal to a an BaseAction of derived class :class:`TopologyAction` (if the topological modification are the
        same of course).

        This implies that the attributes :attr:`BaseAction.authorized_keys` is not checked in this method.

        Note that if 2 actions doesn't act on the same powergrid, or on the same backend (eg number of loads, or
        generators is not the same in *self* and *other*, or they are not in the same order) then action will be
        declared as different.

        **Known issue** if two backend are different, but the description of the _grid are identical (ie all
        n_gen, n_load, n_line, sub_info, dim_topo, all vectors \*_to_subid, and \*_pos_topo_vect are
        identical) then this method will not detect the backend are different, and the action could be declared
        as identical. For now, this is only a theoretical behaviour: if everything is the same, then probably, up to
        the naming convention, then the powergrid are identical too.

        This method `update` receive complete detailed information about the powergrid, but that does not mean an

        For example, it is possible to derive this class to implement some noise in the generator or load, or flows to
        mimic sensor inaccuracy.

        It is also possible to give fake information about the topology, the line status etc.

        In the Grid2Op framework it's also through the observation that the agent has access to some forecast (the way
        forecast are handled depends are implemented in this class). For example, forecast data (retrieved thanks to
        `chronics_handler`) are processed, but can be processed differently. One can apply load / production forecast to
        each _grid state, or to make forecast for one "reference" _grid state valid a whole day and update this one
        only etc.
        All these different mechanisms can be implemented in Grid2Op framework by overloading the `update` observation
        method.
