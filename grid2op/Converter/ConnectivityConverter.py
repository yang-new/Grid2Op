class ConnectivityConverter(Converter):
    """
    In this converter, you have as many output as pairs of object that can be connected, and your model is asked
    to output 0 if he wants these elements disconnected and 1 if he wants them otherwise.

    This type of modeling is rather hard to "get working" the first time, especially because some "conflict" might
    appear. For example, consider three objects (line for example) on a given substation. You can chose to "connect
    A and B", connect "B and C" but "**not connect** A and C" in this case you need an algorithm to disambuate your
    action.

    **NB** compare to :class:`IdToAct` this converter allows for a smaller size. If you have N elements connected at
    a substation, you end up with `N*(N-1)/2` different action. Compare to IdToAct though, it is expected that your
    algorithm produces more than 1 output.

    **/!\ VERY IMPORTANT /!\** : for this converter to work, it needs to remember the previous state of the grid, so you
    absolutely need to call its method :func:`ConnectivityConverter.convert_obs` a each observation.
