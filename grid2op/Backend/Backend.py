class Backend(GridObjects, ABC):
    """
    This is a base class for each :class:`Backend` object.
    It allows to run power flow smoothly, and abstract the method of computing cascading failures.
    This class allow the user or the agent to interact with an power flow calculator, while relying on dedicated
    methods to change the power grid behaviour.

    An example of a valid backend is provided in the :class:`PandapowerBackend`.

    All the abstract methods (that need to be implemented for a backend to work properly) are:

    - :func:`Backend.load_grid`
    - :func:`Backend.close`
    - :func:`Backend.apply_action`
    - :func:`Backend.runpf`
    - :func:`Backend.copy`
    - :func:`Backend.get_line_status`
    - :func:`Backend.get_line_flow`
    - :func:`Backend.get_topo_vect`
    - :func:`Backend._disconnect_line`
    - :func:`Backend.generators_info`
    - :func:`Backend.loads_info`
    - :func:`Backend.lines_or_info`
    - :func:`Backend.lines_ex_info`

    And, if the flag :attr:Backend.shunts_data_available` is set to ``True`` the method :func:`Backend.shunt_info`
    should also be implemented.
